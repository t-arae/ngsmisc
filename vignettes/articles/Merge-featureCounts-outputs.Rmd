# Reading, Modifying, and Merging Read-Count Files

The `featureCounts` tool outputs read-count files for each sample.  
The `ngsmisc` package provides functions to read these files, rename columns for clarity,
and merge multiple files into a single table.

```{r}
# Locate example read-count output files included in the ngsmisc package.
infs <-
  system.file(package = "ngsmisc", "featurecounts") |>
  fs::dir_ls(regexp = "_gene_counts.txt$")

# Read a read-count file using `fC_read_count()`
ngsmisc::fC_read_count(infs[1])

# Rename the 7th column (sample column) using `rename_fpath_bam()`
ngsmisc::fC_read_count(infs[1]) |>
  ngsmisc::rename_fpath_bam(nth = 7)

# Read multiple read-count files and merge them using `fC_merge_count()`
lapply(infs, ngsmisc::fC_read_count) |>
  lapply(ngsmisc::rename_fpath_bam, nth = 7) |>
  ngsmisc::fC_merge_count()
```

# Writing Merged Read-Count Data to a CSV File

After merging read-count data, you may want to save the results for downstream analysis or sharing.

```{r}
# Locate example read-count files
infs <-
  system.file(package = "ngsmisc", "featurecounts") |>
  fs::dir_ls(regexp = "_gene_counts.txt$")

# Read, rename, merge, and write the merged data to a CSV file
lapply(infs, ngsmisc::fC_read_count) |>
  lapply(ngsmisc::rename_fpath_bam, nth = 7) |>
  ngsmisc::fC_merge_count() |>
  ngsmisc::fC_write_count("count.csv")

# Check the written CSV file
readr::read_csv("count.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::file_delete("count.csv")
```

# Calculating RPM, RPKM, and TPM

Normalization metrics such as RPM (Reads Per Million), RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million),
and TPM (Transcripts Per Million) are commonly used in RNA-seq analysis.  
The `ngsmisc` package provides functions to calculate these metrics from merged read-count tables.

```{r}
# Prepare a merged read-count table
tbl_readcount <-
  system.file(package = "ngsmisc", "featurecounts") |>
  fs::dir_ls(regexp = "_gene_counts.txt$") |>
  lapply(ngsmisc::fC_read_count) |>
  lapply(ngsmisc::rename_fpath_bam, nth = 7) |>
  ngsmisc::fC_merge_count()

# Calculate Reads Per Million mapped reads (RPM)
tbl_readcount |> ngsmisc::fC_calc_rpm() |> dplyr::glimpse()

# Calculate Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads mapped (RPKM)
tbl_readcount |> ngsmisc::fC_calc_rpkm() |> dplyr::glimpse()

# Calculate Transcripts Per Million (TPM)
tbl_readcount |> ngsmisc::fC_calc_tpm() |> dplyr::glimpse()

# Calculate all three metrics in sequence.
tbl_readcount |>
  ngsmisc::fC_calc_rpm() |>
  ngsmisc::fC_calc_rpkm() |>
  ngsmisc::fC_calc_tpm() |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

# Reading, Modifying, and Merging Read-Count **Summary** Files

`featureCounts` also produces summary files that report the number of reads assigned to different categories.  
These can be read, renamed, and merged for multi-sample comparison.

```{r}
# Locate example summary files
infs <-
  system.file(package = "ngsmisc", "featurecounts") |>
  fs::dir_ls(regexp = "_gene_counts.txt.summary$")

# Read a summary file using `fC_read_summary()`
ngsmisc::fC_read_summary(infs[1])

# Rename the 2nd column (sample column) using `rename_fpath_bam()` with `nth` argument
ngsmisc::fC_read_summary(infs[1]) |>
  ngsmisc::rename_fpath_bam(nth = 2)

# Read and merge multiple summary files using `purrr::reduce()` and `dplyr::left_join`
lapply(infs, ngsmisc::fC_read_summary) |>
  lapply(ngsmisc::rename_fpath_bam, nth = 2) |>
  purrr::reduce(dplyr::left_join, by = "Status")
```
